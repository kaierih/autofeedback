# Instant feedback for nbgrader assignments

This module is developed for use in a course at NTNU, where exercises are created using nbgrader. The module has two-fold purpose:
1. Adding preprocessors which "hide" hidden test code in test cell metadata in a non human readable form. A determined student will however be able to access the test code.
2. Adding a number of purpose-built test classes for use in grading produce partial credit where appropriate, and attempt to provide beginner-friendly feedback.
